Open built-in Terminal from the IntelliJ IDEA. 
If you prefer, use the terminal app on your computer.
In the terminal window, `cd` to the project root directory `dl4j-nlp-cuda-example` if not already in.
(_you can use IDE's run-configuration green run button, if you like._)

### Install and setup

To be able to run the apps and tasks we will cover in this project we would need to have the below installed and configured on our local machine (how to do each one of these are outside the scope of the project, although links to resources are provided):

- Docker CE 19.03.2 or higher
- Python 3.7 or higher
- GraalVM CE 19.2.1 or higher (download from [https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases]())
- Maven 3.6.0 or higher
- Nvidia, CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN (7.0) drivers version (Linux and Windows machines only, support for MacOS is unavailable) (see [Resources](#resoures) at the bottom of this post for download and installation details)
- [Valohai CLI](https://docs.valohai.com/tutorials/quick-start-cli.html?highlight=cli) - itâ€™s easy to install and get started with the CLI tool, see [Command-line Usage](https://docs.valohai.com/valohai-cli/index.html?highlight=cli).
- Ensure you have opened an account on [https://valohai.com](), see [https://app.valohai.com/accounts/signup/]() 

#### Valohai configuration and setup

After install the [Valohai CLI](https://docs.valohai.com/valohai-cli/index.html?highlight=cli), we will have to do the below:

- clone this repo

```bash  
  $ git clone https://github.com:valohai/dl4j-nlp-cuda-example.git
  $ cd dl4j-nlp-cuda-example
```

- create a new Valohai project (requires an account on https://valohai.com)
```bash
$ vh project create
```  
```bash
  (Resolved create to project create.)
  Project name: dl4j-nlp-cuda-example
  ðŸ˜„  Success! Project dl4j-nlp-cuda-example created.
```

- Go back to your account on [https://valohai.com]() to find this project present:

```bash
$ vh project open
```

Once in your Valohai project, add this git repo (https://github.com/neomatrix369/dl4j-nlp-cuda-example) to the project, under the **Repository** tab page.

- viewing Valohai cloud environments (optional)
```bash
$ vh env 
```

- shortlisting GPU based environments (optional)
```bash
$ vh env -price --queue --gpu
```
List all environments that support GPUs with their price tag and their queue status. 
- getting familiar with the CLI tool
```bash
$ vh lint
$ vh exec list
$ vh exec run --help
```    

### Build the app (remote machine on the cloud)

We mean using the [Valohai CLI](https://docs.valohai.com/tutorials/quick-start-cli.html?highlight=cli) to run executions on the [Valohai](https://valohai.org) platform.

#### CPU & GPU version

```bash
$ vh exec run build-cpu-gpu-uberjar [--adhoc]

### Run `vh exec run --help` to find out more about this command
```

Note: use `--adhoc` only if you have not setup your Valohai project with a git repo or have unsaved commits and want to experiment before being sure of the configuration.

Creates and uploads the artifacts into the Valohai storage which can be referred to later on.
    
### Build the app (local machine)

#### CPU version

```bash
$ BACKEND=cpu ./buildUberJar.sh
```

#### GPU version

Please ensure your environment has access to an Nvidia GPU and the necessary drivers i.e. CUDA, etc...

```bash
$ BACKEND=gpu ./buildUberJar.sh
```

### Building the docker container to run CUDA-enabled Java apps

**For the sake of this project you won't need to do any of the below steps in this section, as we already have a [pre-baked CUDA-enabled docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/neomatrix369/dl4j-nlp-cuda/tags) for your use.** The docker image contains everything mentioned in the pre-requites in the [Install and Setup](#install-and-setup) section.

#### Build docker image

Builds a CUDA-enabled docker image based on [Nvidia's CUDA docker image: nvidia/cuda:10.1-cudnn7-runtime-ubuntu18.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags) and a [GraalVM 19.2.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/findepi/graalvm/tags) image from [findepi](https://hub.docker.com/r/findepi/) 

```bash
$ cd dl4j-nlp-cuda-example/docker
$ ./buildDockerImage.sh
```

#### Push to docker hub

Push the created image to the Docker hub, you need an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

```bash
$ cd dl4j-nlp-cuda-example/docker
$ ./push-docker-image-to-hub.sh
```

You will be prompted for a password to your account when you try to push this to the hub, unless you are already logged in.

#### Run the docker container

In this specific case, running the container would make more sense if you have a machine with a GPU and Nvidia drivers installed and working.
See [Resources](#resources) to find out how to go about with that.

```bash
$ cd dl4j-nlp-cuda-example/docker
$ ./runDockerContainer.sh
```

Although if you look at the [valohai.yaml]() file, it's already done on the Valohai platform. 

### Run app local

#### CPU version

```bash
$ BACKEND=cpu ./runUberJar.sh
```

#### GPU version

Please ensure your environment has access to an Nvidia GPU and the necessary drivers i.e. CUDA, etc...

```bash
$ BACKEND=gpu ./runUberJar.sh
```

Model file created and seeked for in the respective cases, is called `dl4j-nlp-cuda.pb`.

### Run app in docker container

```bash
./runDockerContainer.sh
```

At the prompt in the container, do the same as mentioned in section [Run app local](#run-app-local).
