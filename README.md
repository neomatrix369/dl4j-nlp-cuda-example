# DL4J NLP examples

Open built-in Terminal from the Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA. 
If you prefer, use the terminal app on your computer.
In the terminal window, `cd` to the project root directory `dl4j-nlp` if not already in.
(_you can use IDE's run-configuration green run button, if you like._)
